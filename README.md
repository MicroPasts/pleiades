## Introduction

This project demonstrates the use of Peripleo to map Linked Ancient World Data (LAWD) from the Pleiades project. Peripleo is a powerful tool for visualizing and exploring historical geographic data.

## Linked Open Data

This project integrates Linked Open Data from various sources to enrich the mapping experience:

- **Wikidata**: A free and open knowledge base that can be read and edited by both humans and machines.
- **VIAF**: The Virtual International Authority File combines multiple name authority files into a single OCLC-hosted name authority service.
- **Wikipedia**: A free online encyclopedia, created and edited by volunteers around the world.
- **Trismegistos**: An interdisciplinary portal of papyrological and epigraphical resources.
- **Nomisma**: A collaborative project to provide stable digital representations of numismatic concepts.
- **Library of Congress**: The research library that officially serves the United States Congress.
- **Geonames**: A geographical database available and accessible through various web services.
- **Getty**: The Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names (TGN) is a structured vocabulary containing names and other information about places.
